My name is Thiago de Arruda and I'm a freelance programmer living in
[Recife/Brasil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife). I also do a lot of open
source as can be seen in my [github profile](https://github.com/tarruda).

If you have questions, suggestions or feedbacks regarding one of my projects or
posts, I'd be happy to read about it. Just contact me through
[email](mailto:tpadilha84@gmail.com), [github](https://github.com/tarruda) or
IRC/freenode(nick tarruda).
